### Project Type: Solo | Language: C++ / OpenGL

This project was developed for my dissertation in the final year of my BSc in Computer Science with Games Development. [Full dissertation available here.](docs/dissertation.pdf)

The terrain is generated using my implementation of the ***diamond square algorithm*** in C++ and rendered using OpenGL. It is generated infinitely in a uniform grid. In order to improve performance ***tessellation*** was implemented in the shaders so that terrain that was closer to the camera was more detailed than terrain that was further away.
