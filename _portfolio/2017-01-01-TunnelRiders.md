### Project Type: Solo | Language: C++ / DirectX

> Fly through the endless tunnels avoiding obstacles, collecting power-ups, and scoring points. The longer you live the harder it becomes and you only get 1 life.

This game is built on top of a component-entity game engine of my own design, which has been kept as generic as possible so that it can be used again to make different games in the future.

[Source code available here](https://github.com/SamMurphy/TunnelRiders)

The engine supports 2D and 3D rendering, and has additional support for rendering UI components.

The game can be played in single player or with 2 players competing at the same time.
