This is my coursework project for a second year module, '3D Graphics and Simulation' at the University of Hull. I received a mark of 83%. It was developed in C# & OpenGL using shaders.

The column is a series of boxes stacked on top of each other. The top box serves as an emitter box, randomly spawning different balls. The second and third boxes contain various cylinders for the spheres to collide with. The final box features the 'Sphere of Doom', when a ball collides with it, it loses size or is destroyed depending on how far into the sphere of doom it goes.
