This project, written in javascript using the three.js library, demonstates different techniques for generating realistic looking terrain.

Currently it only supports perlin noise generation and the controls don't do anything yet, but soon it should support; diamond-square, perlin noise, simplex noise, 3D perlin noise, brownian motion, particle deposition, and any other algorithms that I can find.
