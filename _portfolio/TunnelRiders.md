> Fly through the endless tunnels avoiding obstacles, collecting power-ups, and scoring points. The longer you live the harder it becomes and you only get 1 life.

This game is built on top of a component-entity game engine of my own design, which has been kept as generic as possible so that it can be used again to make different games in the future.

The engine supports 2D and 3D rendering, and has additional support for rendering UI components.

The game can be played in single player or with 2 players competing at the same time.
