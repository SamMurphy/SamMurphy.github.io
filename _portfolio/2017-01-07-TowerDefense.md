I was responsible for creating the all of the gun mechanics, and the bullets used by both the guns and the turrets. I designed the system to be as modular and reusable as possible, allowing; the fire mode, number of projectiles, projectile type, recoil, muzzle flash, muzzle velocity, and shell ejection to be controlled through the unity inspector.
