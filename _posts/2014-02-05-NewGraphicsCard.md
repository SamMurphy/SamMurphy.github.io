I’ve recently acquired a spanking new graphics card, the Gigabyte Wind force 3x R9 280x. It’s a rather good card, part of AMDs latest range meaning that it supports Mantle a new low level graphics API allowing for to developers to create more efficient more optimised games which means better performance in the games that support. As well as having mantle support the card also features 3GB of GDRR5 memory which should suffice for some time. Aside from the specifications of the card, it’s also very pretty card which is perhaps the most important factor when choosing a graphics card!
