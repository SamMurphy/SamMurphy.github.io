I haven’t done much with my server in a while, I had planned on sticking it in to a Fractal Design R4 to help reduce the noise, however to save costs I decided against this. Instead I’ve decided to replace the old, unbranded power supply with a nice, quite low power (ish) one from the Corsair builder series range. As this power supply is modular it also allowed me to improve the cable management and airflow around the case. I was also able to upgrade the processor, to the quad core from my main rig as I got a new processor for that. Both of these improvements mean that everything I run on it is quite a lot faster and it does so silently.
