In order to take advantage of my new headphones (Audio Technica ATH-M35s) I decided to buy a standalone microphone so that I didn’t have to switch to my headset to play games and talk. After some research I settled on Blues snowball microphone. It’s a ball shaped USB condenser microphone with a three pattern switch, the first of which is cardioid (heart shape) which is good for doing voice overs or VOIP, the second pattern is the same as the first but -20db which makes it good for loud environments such my dorm room, the third and final pattern is Omni directional which is intended for recording music or conducting interviews.

The sound quality of the microphone is excellent, although it does pick up quite a lot of background noise (I am in a loud environment) which can be a pain. Another issue that I have with it is that it picks up vibrations though I expect this can be fixed if I was willing to invest in a shock mount and a proper mic stand.

Overall I’m very happy with the snowball as despite its issues the quality is still outstanding and it means that I can take advantage of my headphones in all situations giving me a better experience all around.
