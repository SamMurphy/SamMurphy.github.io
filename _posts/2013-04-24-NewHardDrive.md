I’ve been running out of space on my 1TB hard drive, so I bought myself a nice 3TB Seagate Barracuda to replace. I haven’t quite decided what to do with the 1TB drive, but I’m sure I’ll find a use for it. When I went to install my new drive I found that my PC was rather dusty so I took it outside to give it a clean.

To clean it I used some 5* Air Duster that I got off Amazon, it’s just a can of compressed air you’ll be able to find it quite easily if you ever want to clean your pc. After blasting the computer with a can full it was a bit better, some of the fans still had a bit of caked on dust so I used a small paint brush to get it off.

After that I brought it back inside and set about trying to find my way through the web of cables in the back of my case to find the necessary SATA cables, one of my next projects is to mod my Antec 300 to have some decent cable management a feature that is currently lacking. Once I found the cables I simple had to screw in the drive and plug in the cables before closing the case up and powering the pc up.

Once in windows I noticed that the drive was only showing as 2.19TB, in order to fix this I had to convert it to a GPT. You can do that fairly simply though windows disk management. Once the converted and formatted I set about transferring the data from my full to the brim 1TB hard drive, which didn’t take as long as I expected, a bit over an hour in total most of which was spent copying across all my steam games.

Overall the new drive fits in nicely as a storage drive alongside my SSD, I can now install all of my steam games and fill my drive up with lots more films and TV. If you’re in the market for a new hard drive, then I can strongly recommend the Seagate barracuda 3TB.
